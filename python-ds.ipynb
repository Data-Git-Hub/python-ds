    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this assignment, I apply foundational Python skills related to data structures and notebook-based workflows. Using Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code, I complete a series of exercises that demonstrate proficiency with lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets, while also exploring functions and basic control flow. The project emphasizes clear documentation using Markdown, code execution, and exporting work to HTML, reinforcing best practices for reproducibility and communication in data analytics. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "Perform the tasks described in the Markdown cells below.  When you have completed the assignment make sure your code cells have all been run (and have output beneath them) and ensure you have committed and pushed ALL of your changes to your assignment repository. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Every question that requires you to write code will have a code cell underneath it; you may either write your entire solution in that cell or write it in a python file (`.py`), then import and run the appropriate code to answer the question. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not use external modules (`math`, etc) for this assignment unless you are explicitly instructed to, though you may use built in python functions (`min`, `max`, etc) as you wish. <br>\n",
